The `eps` (epsilon) and `min_samples` are two key parameters in the DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) algorithm. 
Here's a detailed explanation of each parameter and how they work:

### `eps` (Epsilon)
- **Definition:** The maximum distance between two samples for one to be considered as in the neighborhood of the other.
- **Role:** It defines the radius of a neighborhood around a point. Points within this distance from a given point are considered its neighbors.
- **Impact:** A smaller `eps` value will result in smaller clusters, potentially considering more points as noise. A larger `eps` value will result in larger clusters but may merge distinct clusters together.

### `min_samples`
- **Definition:** The number of samples (or total weight) in a neighborhood for a point to be considered as a core point. This includes the point itself.
- **Role:** It defines the minimum number of points required to form a dense region (a core point). 
- **Impact:** A higher `min_samples` value will result in fewer clusters with more points labeled as noise. A lower `min_samples` value will result in more clusters, possibly including clusters of noise points.

### How DBSCAN Works

1. **Core Points:** A point is a core point if it has at least `min_samples` points within `eps` distance (including itself).
2. **Border Points:** A point is a border point if it is within `eps` distance of a core point but does not have enough points within `eps` to be a core point itself.
3. **Noise Points:** A point is a noise point if it is not a core point or a border point.

The algorithm starts with an arbitrary point and retrieves its `eps`-neighborhood:
- If the point is a core point, a new cluster is started.
- The algorithm then recursively gathers all density-connected points to this cluster.
- If the point is not a core point and not a border point, it is labeled as noise (but this point might later be found to be a border point of another cluster).

### Choosing `eps` and `min_samples`

#### 1. **Choosing `eps`**
A common method to choose `eps` is to plot the k-distance graph:
- Calculate the distance to the k-th nearest neighbor for every point in the dataset (where k = `min_samples`).
- Plot these distances in ascending order.
- Look for an "elbow" in the plot, which represents a good `eps` value.

#### 2. **Choosing `min_samples`**
A good starting point for `min_samples` is usually:
- `min_samples = 2 * number_of_features` for high-dimensional data.
- For low-dimensional data, it can be set to a higher value, such as 5 or more.

### Example Code to Determine `eps` using the k-distance Graph

```python
from sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Use the scaled data for this analysis
X = X_scaled

# Fit Nearest Neighbors
nearest_neighbors = NearestNeighbors(n_neighbors=5)  # where 5 is a typical starting point
neighbors = nearest_neighbors.fit(X)
distances, indices = neighbors.kneighbors(X)

# Sort the distances and plot
distances = np.sort(distances[:, 4])  # 4th column: k-distance for k=5
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.plot(distances)
plt.title('k-distance Graph for determining eps')
plt.xlabel('Data Points sorted by distance')
plt.ylabel('k-distance')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

### Example Code to Perform DBSCAN

```python
from sklearn.cluster import DBSCAN
from sklearn.metrics import silhouette_score

# Choose eps and min_samples based on k-distance graph and domain knowledge
eps_value = 1.0  # Replace with the value obtained from k-distance graph
min_samples_value = 5  # Choose based on data and domain knowledge

# Perform DBSCAN clustering
dbscan = DBSCAN(eps=eps_value, min_samples=min_samples_value)
y_dbscan = dbscan.fit_predict(X)

# Check if DBSCAN found more than one cluster
if len(set(y_dbscan)) > 1:
    silhouette_avg_dbscan = silhouette_score(X, y_dbscan)
    print(f'DBSCAN Silhouette Score: {silhouette_avg_dbscan:.2f}')
else:
    print("DBSCAN did not find more than one cluster. Try adjusting the parameters.")
```

### Explanation

1. **k-Distance Graph:**
   - Calculates the distance to the 5th nearest neighbor for each point.
   - Plots these distances in ascending order to find an "elbow" which suggests a good `eps` value.

2. **DBSCAN Clustering:**
   - Uses the chosen `eps` and `min_samples` values.
   - Checks if more than one cluster is found and calculates the silhouette score if so.

By carefully choosing `eps` and `min_samples` values based on your data, you can optimize the performance of DBSCAN and obtain meaningful clusters.
